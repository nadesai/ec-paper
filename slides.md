% `ec`: A Haskell Elliptic-Curve Cryptography Library 
% Created by Brandon Azad and Nikhil Desai

# Intro
* A new library for ECC.
* Advantages:
    * Modular
    * Cleanly implemented
    * Readily exensible
* Provides performant implementations while retaining flexibility

# Motivation
* Cryptography research: creating new _schemes_ for encryption/authentication
    * Innovative mixing and matching of different primitives
    * Making incremental improvements to existing ones
    * Collaboration/extensibility necessary
* Don't want researchers to reinvent the wheel
    * Want a clean, easily-utilized framework for testing
    * Insipired by Cryptol
* Existing libraries kind of suck

# Why Haskell?
* Clean specifications possible without sacrificing performance
* Good for mathematical abstraction

# Language of elliptic curve cryptography 

# Use/Library Design

# Implementation

# Key typeclasses

# The `Field` typeclass

# The `EllipticCurve` and `EllipticCurvePoint` type relations 

# Optimization and efficiency 

# "Interfacing" with OpenSSL

# Future work
